# How

## Bugs

If you find a bug that risks destabilizing a project, please:

- File an issue immediately
- Provide a sample repo URL (where possible)
- Provide the state of the working tree (`git status > status.log`) and relevant diffs (`git diff > diff.log`) and attach them inline (within code-block backticks) in the ticket.

## Feature Requests

File an issue with something specific. If it's short enough to fit into an alias, please end the filename with `.alias.txt`.

## Pull Requests

Would you like to improve or add a new script, or convert an existing script in one supported langauge to another?

Pull requests are more than welcome! Thanks in advance :smile:
